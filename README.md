# sys-menumusic
A Nintendo switch sysmodule that aims to add Home Menu music to the switch like the consoles before it

# Note
- sys-tune should get this functionality eventually, but until then and until I fix this version <br> you can use the release from [my fork of sys-tune](https://github.com/rakib-shahid/sys-tune-menu-only). <br> This fork works perfectly
- The module automatically plays the file "SD:/music/home.mp3" on the home menu
- Currently not meant to be used as audio crackle is quite bad, but feel free to try it from releases

# Music Credit
The mp3 file included in the release is composed by [Thaddeus Silva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYTnx6l8RIs)

# BUGS
- [ ] Audio crackles after opening any apps (unsure of cause)
